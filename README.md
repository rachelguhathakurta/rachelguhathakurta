# Hi, I'm Rachel Guhathakurta

M&T sophomore (Wharton + Penn Engineering). I like building scrappy, real-world things: purpose-built AI, tidy data pipes, and simple UIs that feel delightful. I’m happiest when we can click it, test it, and smile quickly — ship small, learn fast, iterate.

## What I’m into
- AI-enabled automation for robotics/ops (inspired by Burro.AI)
- Right-sized models and privacy-first compute (edge when it makes sense)
- Smart retrieval/search (RAG, ANN/HNSW) over brute force
- Java/Python builds with tests so they behave

## A few things I’ve built / explored

- ML for Behavioral Intervention — CNN prototype (~93% accuracy) and habit app
- Orbit Determination (SSP) — asteroid 1998 SG36, least-squares → MPC submission
- Jungle Runner — tiny Java 8 + Swing game (crisp input, interactive 8-bit pixelated UI)

## Currently exploring
- Distillation vs fine-tuning trade-offs
- Composable agents with guardrails
- Zero-trust patterns for private inference
